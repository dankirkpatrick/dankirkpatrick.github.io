I'm Dan Kirkpatrick.  This blog is intended to document a number of the projects I'm working on.  Here's an idea of things I hope to discuss here:

- The PurplePrintr.  Designed by my good friend, Macaba, this is a Delta 3D printer built using standard OpenBuilds V-Slot extrusion.  The effector and delta rods are connected using magnet.  The effector has a rather unique Z probe.
-- Porting Rich Cattell's autocalibration updates for Marlin firmware to the Smoothieware firmware platform.  Rich Cattell's delta printer autocalibration is the most advanced I've seen, so I'm doing a port to the Smoothieware platform.  I'm making some improvements, too, particularly in the modularity of the code, so that it fits in better with the Smoothie code base.
-- Z Probe Experiments.  We'll be conducting all sorts of experiments aimed at getting the most reliable and cost effective Z probe for 3D printers.  
-- 3D Printer Component Comparisons.  The PurplePrintr proveds an excellent platform for performing true apples-to-apples comparisons between various printer parts.  I'll start with a hot-end shootout, comparing the Hexagon, J-Head, and E3D hotends.  I hope to follow up with a comparison of Marlin, RAMPS, and the Azteeg X5 Mini.  I'd also like to do an article comparing driving the heated bed with 12V compared to 24V.  I'm open to additional suggestions--just email me.
- The PurpleRoutr.  This is based upon the OpenBuilds Ox CNC router.  We're aiming for a black/purple color scheme to match the PurplePrintr.  I'm sure we'll make some modifications as we get the first one built.
- The PurplePowr.  This is a bench power supply capable of delivering 0-48V, with a total power output of roughly 800 watts.  This should be sufficient to power a full 3D printer, including the heated bed.
- The PurpleHexr.  This is an emerging research project I'm working on.  I'll discuss this more as the project develops.
- Web Scraping.  I'm building a modular web scraper that I need to collect specific financial data from the web.  I'm hoping to make the scraper fully open-source, and provide a SAAS that aims to connect people that need data with people that build scrapers.  The scraper separates the GUI from the scrapers, allowing for distributed scraping with central data storage.  I'm hoping to include data syndication pieces, allowing data repositories to connect to one another for fully distrubted data storage, as well.  Again, this is an emerging project for me, so more details will be made available over time. 
- Programming Spheros and Ollies.  I've been working with the Maker's Club I conduct at my children's school to program Spheros and Ollies using CylonJS.  This allows me to control the devices using an XBox controller, synchronize multiple devices for a "Sphero Ballet", and much more.  CylonJS also supports loads of inputs and outputs, and may become my go-to framework for rapid development of microcontroller-driven devices.
- Building Mods for Minecraft.  Another project of interest to many of the students I work with is the design and development on Minecraft mods.  I'll document some of the approaches that I've used successfully here.
